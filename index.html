    <section>
        <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my personal website. üëãüèª</p>
        <p>
            A few words about me from me: I'm a pretty nice dude. Aww dude, thanks for saying that. You're welcome dude.
            I live in San Francisco. I like sci-fi and fantasy novels. I'm trying to liberate myself from the illusion
            of the self. I tend to write about how difficult it is to write, and post on social media about quitting
            social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm happily employed by <a href="https://specto.dev">Specto</a>. I'm a software developer: basically I tell
            computers what to do while they try their best to misconstrue my instructions and crap out. Previously I
            worked at <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://life360.com">Life360</a> and my own
            company.

        <h2>Subscribe to My Newsletter</h2>
        <p>
            If you give me your email I will add you to my altar. If you are one of the first 1000 subscribers I will
            send you a personal message‚Äîprobably of gratitude, we'll see. I will also email you when I do things I deem
            newsworthy. This will happen rarely or not at all.

            deciding to get rid of my TV altogether. I post my article on Hacker News and <a
                    href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14942355">reach the frontpage</a>. Someone calls me a

        <p>I work on a side project with a couple of friends. We launch a safety monitoring app for Android with a grand
            vision: to help seniors live at home and their caregivers feel at ease. We apply to the Expa Labs startup
            incubator and reach the final interview stage. We don't make the cut. We eventually abandon the project.</p>

        <p>I write about a personal insight: that while excessive media consumption is bad for my general productivity,
            it is even worse for my well-being. I post my article on Hacker News and
            <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4681095">reach the frontpage</a> for the very first time. Yay!

        <p>An organization I co-founded, Cyber Nation, sponsors StarCraft 2 players. The North American Star League is
            selecting participants by asking players to submit a video where they answer a series of questions in order
            to gauge fan interest in the players. I help record and produce MoMaN's video. It blows up, gathering 70k+
            views, and he becomes part of the 50 players invited to participate.
