    <h1>Don't Worry About Your Productivity, Worry About You</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">October 21, 2012</p>
    <section>
        <p>After years of roaming the Internet, its video clips, its news aggregators (I’m looking at you Reddit and
            Hacker News), I’ve become very familiar with a feeling of restlessness. Like I want, or need, to constantly
            feed information to my mind.</p>
        <p>Now I think I’m not alone when I say this frequent need to consume content has taken a toll on my
            productivity. At the very least, if it hasn't been too detrimental to my work, it might not be the best use
            of my free time.</p>
        <p>But, as with all things enjoyable (and Internet seems to be in good standing with the short-term pleasure
            centers of our brains), it’s a very tough habit to kick. Ultimately you’ll always wonder why abandon
            something you enjoy, and you’ll think about going back often.</p>
        <p>Today, I’m happy to say I have kicked this particular habit, and I don’t think I’m going back, ever. And the
            reason is precisely the restlessness I mentioned earlier. I realized, in fact, I was no longer enjoying the
            moment. I couldn't pause anymore. I felt averse to things that didn't hold my attention like my computer
            screen can.</p>
        <p>So I stopped. I stopped using Internet as a time-filler. I stopped time-filling altogether. My overarching
            philosophy now is <strong>to immerse myself completely in what I’m doing at any given moment, to do only
                what I’ll be glad I did later, when I look back, and to always take my time.</strong></p>
        <p>This for me means no more Reddit and Hacker News, no more casual Youtubing, no more games for gaming’s sake.
            I’ve stopped using my Rapidshare account aggressively. I’ve even cut back on listening to music while I
            work. I already didn't Facebook or Tweet.</p>
        <p>Instead I read carefully selected books. I write, I exercise, I spend time with the people I love. Sometimes
            I do nothing, because sometimes nothing needs to be done.</p>
        <p>I don’t plan my next entertainment fix halfway through the present one. I don’t feel guilty for squandering
            my time. I’m not as stressed as I used to be. The realization that this was really having an impact came to
            me in my car, actually. It struck me that I wasn't paying close attention to my speed anymore, because I
            didn't care about going as fast as I could. I didn't care about passing other cars, or getting to places
            quickly for no particular reasons. I didn't mind red lights or small traffic jams. I could coexist with a
            population of idiot drivers.</p>
        <p>As far as I can see, cutting back on constant content consumption has been the root cause for what feels like
            a very refreshing change of pace. This to me holds infinitely more value than the idea of “being more
            productive” and it goes to show that these habits can in fact be detrimental to our mental health and to our
            enjoyment of life in general.</p>
